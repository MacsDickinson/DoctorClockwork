  You know the rules and so do I
  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
  You wouldn't get this from any other guy

  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
  Gotta make you understand

  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

  We've known each other for so long
  Your heart's been aching, but
  You're too shy to say it
  Inside, we both know what's been going on
  We know the game and we're gonna play it

  And if you ask me how I'm feeling
  Don't tell me you're too blind to see

  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

  (Ooh, give you up)
  (Ooh, give you up)
  Never gonna give, never gonna give
  (Give you up)
  Never gonna give, never gonna give
  (Give you up)

  We've known each other for so long
  Your heart's been aching, but
  You're too shy to say it
  Inside, we both know what's been going on
  We know the game and we're gonna play it

  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
  Gotta make you understand

  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</template></category>
